title: "MetaSRA: normalized human sample-specific metadata for the Sequence Read Archive"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/metasra_2017
excerpt: 'The NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; 
however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. We present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA human sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the 
metadata organization of the ENCODE project. The MetaSRA is available at metasra.biostat.wisc.edu <metasra.biostat.wisc.edu> via both a searchable web interface and bulk downloads.'
