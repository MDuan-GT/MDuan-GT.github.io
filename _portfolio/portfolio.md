Human bone marrow (BM) plasma cells (BMPC) are heterogeneous ranging from newly arrived nascent antibody secreting cells (ASC) which mature into long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) which are exceedingly rare in the BM microniche. In 2015, Halliley et al. discovered that LLPC exist in CD19-CD38hiCD138+ human bone marrow subset and are responsible for long-lived viral antibodies in serum. In 2018, using bulk RNA-seq, Nguyen & Garimalla et al. identified important differences between BM short-lived plasma cell (SLPC) and LLPC, such as downregulation of genes in Oxphos, mTOR1 signaling, E2F targets, G2M checkpoint in LLPC and upregulation of $TNF \alpha$ signaling via $NF \kappa B$ and Hypoxia. In 2019, Garimalla, Nguyen & Halliley et al. observed similar pathway alterations between blood CD19+ and CD19- populations and showed blood ASC survival potential in a human in vitro cell culture system.
