THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Matrices are a fundamental concept in linear algebra and are ubiqutous across nearly every field of science and engineering.  In my opinion, matrices are introduced to students in a myopic way that hides the many ways that matrices are interpreted and utilized.  

The problem is that matrices can be viewed through multiple lenses; however, when they're first introduced, they are introduced through only one lense. This is likely a concious strategy to avoid overwhelming students; however, at least for me, this approach brought more confusion than it would have otherwise.  

How are matrices introduced?  Sometimes, matrices are introduced as simply, "a rectangular array of numbers," as is the case in the [Wikipedia entry on matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).  In other cases, such as in the linear algebra course I took as a college sophomore, matrices were introduced as datastructures for efficiently encoding systems of linear equations. 

After such explanations, I was left to wander: *okay, but what IS a matrix?* That is, I knew that there must be something deeper than simply their role as a datastrucutre. It wasn't until I started using linear algebra in practice that I started to get an intuitive handle on what they are. 

However, I wonder that if matrices were better explained at the outset, would I have been set up to understand them much better at the start. This blog post is an attempt at such an introduction.  This introduction depends on a solid understanding of vectors and vector spaces. 

What *IS* a matrix?
-------------

So what *are* matrices?  Well, as I discuss in my [previous blog post](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/understanding_3d/) some concepts require viewing at multiple angles to grasp their true nature. I think matrices are one of those concepts.

The three main angles to view a matrix are as follows:

1. **As a table of data:** The most simple and least abstract way to view a matrix is simply as a two-dimensional array of values. That is, a table. 
2. **As a list of vectors:** Getting a little bit more abstract, a matrix can also be viewed as a collection of vectors in a finite dimensional [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space).
3. **As a linear transformation:** The most abstract way to view a matrix is as an encoding of a *function* between vector spaces.  Specifically, a matrix can be used to encode a [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) between finite-dimensional vector spaces. It is this abstract angle of viewing matrices that lies at the core of the mathematical field of linear algebra.  

In real world use, some matrices need only be interpreted through one of the aforementioned lenses; however, in some cases a matrix must be viewed through *all three*.  Thus, using matrices in practice often requires mentally switching between all three of these ways of viewing/interpreting matrices.  

Toy example: Markov chains

For the remainder of the blog post, I'll use [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) as an example application of matrices that illustrates how one often requires jumping between the three angles of viewing matrices.
