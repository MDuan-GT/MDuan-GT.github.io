THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Matrices are a fundamental concept in linear algebra and are ubiqutous across science and engineering. On their surface, a matrix is simply a two-dimensional array of values. For example, the following is a matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix}1 & -2 & 0 \\ 4 & -3 & 1 \\ 0 & 6 & -2 \end{bmatrix}$$

As I discuss in my [previous blog post](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/understanding_3d/) some concepts require viewing at multiple angles to grasp their true nature. I think matrices are one of those concepts and I believe it would have helped me as a sophomore in my college linear algebra course, if a high-level, multi-perspective overview of matrices was provided in order to provide a framework for future learning. 

The three main angles to view a matrix are as follows:

1. **As a table of data:** The most simple and least abstract way to view a matrix is simply as a two-dimensional array of values. That is, a table. 
2. **As a list of vectors:** Getting a little bit more abstract, a matrix can also be viewed as a collection of vectors in a finite dimensional [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space).
3. **As a linear transformation:** The most abstract way to view a matrix is as an encoding of a *function* between vector spaces.  Specifically, a matrix can be used to encode a [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) between finite-dimensional vector spaces. It is this abstract angle of viewing matrices that lies at the core of the mathematical field of linear algebra.  

In real world use, some matrices need only be interpreted through one of the aforementioned lenses; however, in some cases a matrix must be viewed through *all three*.  Thus, using matrices in practice often requires mentally switching between all three of these ways of viewing/interpreting matrices.  

Toy example: Markov chains

For the remainder of the blog post, I'll use [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) as an example application of matrices that illustrates how one often requires jumping between the three angles of viewing matrices.
