Statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning-based binary classification are two very different frameworks for making binary decisions with data. A [recent article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920301562) by Jingyi Jessica Li and Xin Tong discusses the differences between these two strategies and offers guidance on which one to choose for a given decision-problem at hand.  I found this article to be very well-written and important and provides a thorough description of the *differences* between these two strategies rather on their similarities. Indeed, the two strategies are very different given that they were born from two different scientific fields (statistics and computer science); however I think it is helpful to also understand how these two strategies are similar. In this post, I will create a unified framework for thinking about decision-making algorithms and will place statistical testing and machine learning into this common conceptual framework.
