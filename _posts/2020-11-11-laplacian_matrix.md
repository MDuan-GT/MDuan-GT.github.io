THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

*Spectral clustering is a popular clustering algorithm.  At the heart of this algorithm lies a matrix called the graph Laplacian.  In this post, I'll walk through the intuition behind the graph Laplacian and describe how it represents the discrete analogue to the Laplacian operator on continuous multivariate functions.*
