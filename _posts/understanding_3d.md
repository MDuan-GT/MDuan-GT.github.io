One of the most important and, in my opinion, overlooked skill sets in academics is that of understanding the state of one’s own knowledge.  That is, to understand what you really truly know versus what you only partially know in order to address gaps in your understanding. 

As a first what does it mean to truly understand something?  In this post, I’ll provide an analogy that I find helpful for determining when I truly understand something. As a teacher, this analogy also helps me to articulate my goals.   

The analogy is as follows: An abstract, complex concept is akin to an object that resides in three-dimensional space.  One only partially understands the concept if they are only able to see the object in 2-dimensions by projecting the object down into 2-dimensional space. One finally fully understands the concept when they are able to make the leap from viewing the object in 2-dimensions to seeing the object in 3-dimensions.  Making this leap is often accompanied by an “aha” moment.

This analogy is well illustrated by the image on the cover of Godel, Escher, Bach by
