*In this post, I will discuss an analogy that I find useful for thinking about what it means to "understand" something. Specifically, the analogy is that true understanding of a concept is akin to "seeing" the concept in its native 3D space, whereas partial understanding is merely to see a 2D projection of the inherently 3D concept.*

One of the most important and, in my opinion, overlooked skill sets in academics is that of understanding the state of one’s own knowledge.  That is, to understand what you really truly know versus what you only partially know in order to address gaps in your understanding. 

As a first what does it mean to truly understand something?  In this post, I’ll provide an analogy that I find helpful for thinking about what it means to "understand". This analogy also helps guide my teaching goals.   

The analogy is as follows: An abstract, complex concept is akin to an object that resides in three-dimensional space.  True understanding of the concept is to see the object in its 3D space. One only partially understands the concept if they are only able to see the object as two-dimensional projection. One finally fully understands the concept when they are able to make the leap from viewing the object in 2-dimensions to seeing the object in 3-dimensions.  Making this leap is often accompanied by an “aha” moment.

This analogy is well illustrated by the image on the cover of Godel, Escher, Bach by
