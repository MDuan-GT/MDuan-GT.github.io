_The concept of a vector space is a foundational concept in mathematics, physics, and the data sciences. In this post, we first present and explain the definition of a vector space and then go on to describe additional mathematical structures that can be built atop vector spaces in order to create ever-more powerful concepts. From vector spaces, we will define inner product spaces, normed vector spaces, Banach spaces, and finally, Hilbert spaces, which are generalization of Euclidean spaces._

Introduction
------------

In this post, we will first present vector spaces and then will build upon this concept to evermore complex spaces. Specifically, we will define and discuss the following mathematical concepts:

1. Vector spaces
2. Inner product spaces
3. Normed vector spaces
4. Banach spaces
5. Hilbert spaces
