THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

As we have discussed in depth, matrices can viewed [as functions](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/matrices_as_functions/) between vector spaces. In this post, we will discuss matrices that represent **invertible functions**. Such matrices are called **invertible matrices** and their corresponding invertible function is characterized by their **inverse matrix**.
