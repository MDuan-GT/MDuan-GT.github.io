Matrix multiplication is an operation between two matrices that creates a new matrix such that given two matrices $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$, each column of the product $\bold{AB}$ is formed by multiplying $\bold{A}$ by each column of $\bold{B}$ (Definition~\ref{def:matrix_mult}).  

Note that this definition requires that if we multiply an $m \times n$ matrix by a $n \times p$ matrix, the result will be an $m \times p$ matrix where the number of rows is determined by the first matrix and the number of columns is determined by the second matrix.  More succinctly: 
 $$\bold{A}_{m \times n} \ \bold{B}_{n \times p} = \bold{(AB)}_{m \times p}$$
