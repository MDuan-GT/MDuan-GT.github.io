Introduction
---------

At a high level RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) measures the transcription of each gene in a biological sample (i.e. a group of cells or a single single).  The type of data that RNA-seq provides is relatively complex and because of this complexity, there is a good amount of confusion regarding the units of gene expression derived from RNA-seq data and the various methods used for normalizing these expression measurements across samples. In this post, I will discuss how the various normalization methods that are used in RNA-seq analysis result from the following problem: RNA-seq provides a measurement of *relative* gene expression between genes rather than *absolute* gene expression.  I believe that this discrepancy is the cause for much confusion regarding the various units of gene expression derived from RNA-seq as well as the methods for normalizing those measurements between samples.

Just to make sure we're on the same page, let's discuss the basics of RNA-seq.
