With the advent of single-cell genomics, researchers are no able to probe molecular biology at the single-cell level.  That is, scientists are able to measure some aspect of a cell, such as its transcriptome (RNA-seq) or its open chromatin regions (ATAC-seq) for thousands, and [sometimes even millions]() of cells at a time. This new technology has called for new efforts for to map and catalogue all of the cells in the human body.  The premier effort of this kind is the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org), an international consortium of researchers who have set themselves on the journey towards creating "comprehensive reference maps of all human cells—the fundamental units of life—as a basis for both understanding human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease".

Before one even begins to catalogue cell types, one must define what they even mean by "cell type".  This has become a topic of hot debate.  Before the age of single-cell genomics, a rigorous definition was usually not necessary. Colloquially, a cell type is a category of cells in the body that performs a certain function. Commonly, cell types are considered to be relatively stable.  For example, a neuron in one's brain will, as far we know, not spontaneously morph into, say, a liver cell.

Unfortunately, researchers found that a such a fuzzy definition will not suffice as a foundational definition from which one could go on to create "reference maps".  The reason being that with the resolution provided by single-cell technologies, one can find, if they look hard enough, clusters of cells that look similar at extremely fine resolutions.  [Svennson et al. (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baaa073/6008692) found that as researchers measure more cells, they tend to find more "cell types":
