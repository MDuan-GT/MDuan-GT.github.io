With the advent of single-cell genomics, researchers are no able to probe molecular biology at the single-cell level.  That is, scientists are able to measure some aspect of a cell, such as its transcriptome (RNA-seq) or its open chromatin regions (ATAC-seq) for thousands, and [sometimes even millions]() of cells at a time. This new technology has called for new efforts for to map and catalogue all of the cells in the human body.  The premier effort of this kind is the [Human Cell Atlas](), an international consortium of researchers who have set themselves to this task.
