Introduction
----------

It sometimes amazes me that two of the most important relationships, **equality** and **definition**, in mathematics use the exact same symbol: the equal sign -- that is, "=". Early in my learning days, I believe that this [overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) of the "=" symbol led to way more confusion than necessary.  In fact, I believe I still have some residual confusion regarding many basic mathematical concepts that all originate from this unfortunate circumstance.  

To ensure that we're on the same page, let's first define these two relationships. Let's start with equality.  Let's say we have two entities, which we will denote using the symbols $X$ and $Y$.  The statement "$X$ equals $Y$", denoted $X = Y$, means that $X$ and $Y$ **are the same thing**.  Here's an example: given a right-triangle with edge lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse, it holds that 

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

This is the Pythagorean theorem.  Importantly, what this says is that the quantity $c^2$ *is the same quantity* as the quantity $a^2 + b^2$.

Now, let's move to definition. Given the same right triangle where now we let $\theta$ be the angle between the hypotenuse and the edge of length $c$, we say that

$\sin \theta = \frac{b}{c}$

This is a definition. We are **assigning** the symbol/concept $\sin \theta$ to be the quantity $\frac{b}{c}$.

The fundamental difference between equality and definition
