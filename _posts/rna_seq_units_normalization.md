What RNA-seq gives you versus what you want

At a high level RNA-seq measures the transcription of each gene in a biological sample (i.e. a group of cells or a single single).  The type of data that RNA-seq provides is relatively complex and because of this complexity, there is a good amount of confusion regarding the units used in RNA-seq and various methods for normalizing these units across samples.
