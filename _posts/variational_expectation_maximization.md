*Expectation-maximization (EM) is a popular algorithm for performing maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters in a latent variable model. In this post, I discuss an adapation of the EM algorithm, called variational EM, that performs approximate maximum-likelihood estimation when the posterior distribution required in the E-step is untractable. This approach uses *
