_The dot product is a fundamental operation on two Euclidean vectors that captures a notion of similarity between the vectors. In this post, we'll define the dot product and offer a number of angles for which to intuit the idea captured by this fundamental operation._

Introduction
------------

The **dot product** is a fundamental operation on two Euclidean vectors that captures a notion of similarity between the vectors. It is defined as follows:

Given vectors $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{u}$ in $n$-dimensional space, the dot product is defined as,
$$\bold{v} \cdot \bold{u} = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i u_i$$

There are three perspectives I find useful for thinking about the dot products. Ordered from the least abstract to the most abstract, these perspectives are:
1. The dot product succinctly describes a weighted sum
2. The dot describes a notion of similarity between two Euclidean vectors
3. The dot product describes a geometric relationship between two Euclidean vectors
4. The dot product is analogous to the product on scalars

These perspectives are described in the sections below:
