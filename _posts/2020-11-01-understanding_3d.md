*In this post, I will discuss an analogy that I find useful for thinking about what it means to "understand" something. Specifically, the analogy is that true understanding of a concept is akin to "seeing" the concept in its native 3D space, whereas partial understanding is merely seeing a 2D projection of that inherently 3D concept.*

One of the most important and, in my opinion, overlooked skill sets in academics is that of understanding the state of one’s own knowledge.  That is, to understand what you really truly know versus what you only partially know. Without this skill, it is difficult to address gaps in your understanding. 

As a first what does it mean to truly understand something?  In this post, I’ll provide an analogy that I find helpful for thinking about what it means to "understand". This analogy also helps guide my teaching goals.   

The analogy is as follows: An abstract, complex concept is akin to an object that resides in three-dimensional (3D) space.  True understanding of the concept is to see the object in its 3D space. One only partially understands the concept if they are only able to see the object as two-dimensional (2D) projection. One finally fully understands the concept when they are able to make the leap from viewing the object in 2D to seeing the object in 3D.  Making this leap is often accompanied by an “aha” moment.

This analogy is well illustrated by the image on the cover of [Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach):

In this cover, the 3D wooden blocks are akin to some abstract concept.  The various 2D projections are various ways that one can approach or view the concept; however, they are inherently incomplete.  True understanding of the concept is akin to seeing the wooden blocks as they are and being able to manipulate the wooden blocks in your mind.

As a toy example, I will use the concept of Shannon's information entropy, which I have discussed in a [previous blog post](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/entropy/).  As I discussed in that post, there are multiple ways to view the concept of information entropy of a [categorical distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution):
1. As the expected [self-information] over all of the possible events that may occur when sampling from the distribution.
2. As a measure of "uniformness" or "uncertainty" of the distribution.
3. As the minimal expected number of bits required to communicated samples drawn from the distribution, as discussed in my post discussing [Shannon's Source Coding Theorem](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/sourcecoding/).

Each of these perspectives are akin to a 2D projections.  Each 2D projection (i.e, perspective) is incomplete.  Truly understanding the concept of entropy is to intuit how all of these perspectives are really just projections of some "higher dimensional" concept that integrates all of these ideas.

When teaching a concept such as this one, it often must be approached through 2D projections first.  Jumping straight to the 3D object is often too challenging. However, through explaining and exploring multiple 2D projections of the concept, the student will begin to construct the 3D object in their mind. When self-learning, I take this same approach; I first try to grasp the various 2D projections. However I am not satisfied I truly undersatnd the concept until those 2D projections begin to integrate into a 3D object.  Once I am able to manipulate that 3D object at will (i.e., rotate it and form new 2D projections onto new hyperplanes), then I know that really grasp the concept.
