Test:
$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

In this series of posts, I will present my understanding of some basic concepts in measure theory — the mathematical study of objects with “size”— that have enabled me to gain a deeper understanding into the foundations of probability theory.





...
As a computer science undergraduate student, I was taught the basic and incomplete version of probability theory in which discrete outcomes (e.g. a dice roll) are treated quite differently from continuous outcomes (e.g. the temperature outside).  For example, the expectation of a discrete random variable $X$ is given by
$$E(X) := \sum_x P(X=x)$$                                                     
whereas if $X$ is continuous its expectation is given by.  
$$E(X) := \int_x x f(x) \ dx$$
where $f(x)$ is $X$'s density function. 

Not only did I find this division to be unsatisfying, but as I continued to study statistics and machine learning through grad school, I found it to be inadequate for a deeper understanding into the workings of the topics that I was studying. 

I learned that this division, between continuous and discrete distributions, is actually a bridge over a deeper and more complete theory of probability, based on measure theory, that not only unifies the discrete and continuous scenarios, but also extends them. 

In fact, I was surprised to learn that the very formal definition of probability requires measure theory! It is as if the very first step into probability plunges one into a crevice of mathematics. It is no wonder why teachers build a bridge to cross this crevice and avoid measure theory altogether. Sadly, this bridge comes at the cost of a less satisfying, and more tedious explanation of probability.

I'll introduce a bunch of terms in my definition for probability and in the following sections, we will define and discuss each of them.
