THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION


First, we note that the axiom of RKHS means that 

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \ \forall \epsilon_1 > 0, \ \exists \Delta \ \text{such that} \ \forall f, \ 0 \lt \| f-g \| \lt \Delta \implies \|\delta_x(f) - \delta_x(g) \| < \epsilon_1$$

Now, let's assume we have a convergent sequence of functions that converges on some function $f$. That is, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \|\|f_n - f\|\| = 0$. By the definition of the limit of a sequence, this means that

$$\forall \epsilon_2 > 0, \ \exists N \ \text{such that} \ n > N \implies \| f_n - f \| < \epsilon_2$$

Now, lets fix $\epsilon_1$ above and let $\epsilon_2 := \Delta$. Then, $\exists N \ \ text{such that} \ n > N \implies \|\| f_n - f \|\| < \Delta$. 

Which further implies that 

$$\| \delta_x(f_n) - \delta_x(f) \| < \epsilon_1$$

Since $\delta_x(f) := f(x)$, we have that

$$\|f_n(x) - f(x) \| < \epsilon_1$$

Now, since our choice of $\epsilon_1$ was arbitrary, we see that 

$$\forall \epsilon_1 > 0, \ \exists N \ \text{such that} \ n > N \implies \| \delta_x(f_n) - \delta_x(f) \| < \epsilon_1$$

This is the very definition of the limit, 

$$\forall x, \ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \| f_n(x) - f(x) \| = 0$$
