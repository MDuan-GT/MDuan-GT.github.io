<span style="color:#0060C6">**Theorem 1 (Convergence of functions implies pointwise convergence):** Given a RKHS, $\mathcal{H}$, the following holds: $ \ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \vert\vert f_n - f \vert\vert_{\mathcal{H}} = 0 \implies \forall x, \ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \vert f_n(x) - f(x) \vert = 0$.</span>

We assume that we have a convergent sequence of functions that converges on some function $f$. That is, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \|\|f_n - f\|\| = 0$. By the definition of the limit of a sequence, this means that

$$\forall \epsilon_2 > 0, \ \exists N \ \text{such that} \ n > N \implies \| f_n - f \| < \epsilon_2$$

Let's keep this in mind as we look at the axioms of a RKHS. Specifically, we note that the axiom of RKHS means that 

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \ \forall \epsilon_1 > 0, \ \exists \Delta \ \text{such that} \ \forall f, \ 0 \lt \| f-g \| \lt \Delta \implies \vert\delta_x(f) - \delta_x(g)\vert < \epsilon_1$$

Let us fix $\epsilon_1$ above to an arbitrary value and let $\epsilon_2 := \Delta$. Furthermore, let $x$ be a fixed arbitrary value. Then, because we have a convergence sequence of functions, $f_n$, we know that $\exists N \ \text{such that} \ n > N \implies \vert\vert f_n - f \vert\vert_{\mathcal{H}} < \Delta$. 

Based on the axiom of the RKHS, this also implies that 

$$\vert \delta_x(f_n) - \delta_x(f)\vert < \epsilon_1$$

and thus,

$$\vert f_n(x) - f(x)\vert < \epsilon_1$$

Now, since our choices of $\epsilon_1$ and $x$ were arbitrary, we see that 

$$\forall x, \ \forall \epsilon_1 > 0, \ \exists N \ \text{such that} \ n > N \implies \| f_n(x) - f(x) \| < \epsilon_1$$

This is the very definition of the limit, 

$$\forall x, \ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \| f_n(x) - f(x) \| = 0$$

$\square$
