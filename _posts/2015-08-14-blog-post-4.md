*In this series of posts, I present my understanding of some basic concepts in measure theory — the mathematical study of objects with “size”— that have enabled me to gain a deeper understanding into the foundations of probability theory.*

*In part 1 of this series, I presented the measure-theoretic definition for probability. In part 2, I will present the measure-theoretic definition for a random variable.*

Introduction

In part 1 of this series, I introduced the measure-theoretic definition of a probability space:

<span style="color:#0060C6">**Definition 1:** A **probability space** is a measure space ($\Omega$, $E$, $P$) where $P(\Omega) = 1$ where </span>
1. <span style="color:#0060C6">The set $\Omega$, is called the **sample space**.</span>
2. <span style="color:#0060C6">The $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$, denoted $E$, called the set of **events**.</span>
3. <span style="color:#0060C6">The measure $P$ for the measureable space $(\Omega, E)$ is the **probability measure**.</span>

This definition says that a probability space is simply a measure space where the measure P assigns the entire set $\Omega$ (i.e. the "object")  a value of 1.  In a probability space, the set Ω is called the sample space, and a subset of the sample-space e ∈ E is called an event. 

I interpret this definition as follows: The sample space represents all conceivable futures and and an event represents some subset of conceivable futures. The probability measure assigns each event e a value between 0 and 1, which represents our degree of certainty that our future will be contained in the event.  Specifically, 1 represents full certainty that our future will be contained in the event and 0 represents full certainty that our future will not be contained in the event.
