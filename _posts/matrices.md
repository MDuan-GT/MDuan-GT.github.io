Matrices are a fundamental concept in linear algebra and are ubiqutous across nearly every field of science and engineering.  In my opinion, matrices are introduced to students in a myopic way that hides the many ways that matrices are interpreted and utilized.  The problem, is that matrices can be thought about in multiple ways and each way is equally important.  By only   

Sometimes, matrices are introduced as simply, "a rectangular array of numbers," as is the case in the [Wikipedia entry on matrices]().  Personally, in my undergraduate linear algebra course, matrices were first introduced as a way to efficiently encode a system of linear equations. For example, the system of linear equations

$$\begin{align*}2x_1 + 4x_2 &= 6 \\ x_1 - 3x_2 &= 2\end{align*}$$

would be encoded as a the *augmented matrix*
