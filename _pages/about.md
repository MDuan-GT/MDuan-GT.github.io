I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Morgridge Institute for Research in Madison, Wisconsin and conduct research in the area of biomedical data science.  I research novel statistical and computational methods for mining large, publicly available genomics databases. I am drawn towards problems that call for building bridges between fields, perspectives, and approaches.
