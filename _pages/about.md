I'm an optimistic and positive person, I believe in everything that happens to me shapes me to a better version of myself. So, I always embrace each moment and push myself moving forward.

As a dedicated and persistent scientist, I am passionate and highly motivated to make meaningful contributions in the field of healthcare by uncovering innovative treatments that can eradicate the disease, alleviate patient suffering, and eventually lead to an enhanced quality of life for patients. 

To filfill my faith, I applied and was admitted to [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2016, where I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in Bioinformatics, as well as an M.S. in Statistics in 2022. Subsequently, I joined [Immunitas Therapeutics](https://www.immunitastx.com) as a computational biology scientist upon completing my studies. 

In the course of my academic studies, I researched and developed a computational workflow that could effectively and more accurately analyze scRNAseq data generated from antibody secreting cells (ASCs) in various contexts. By utilizing state-of-the-art single-cell methods to analyze these datasets, we have gained a more comprehensive understanding on ASCs' fundamental biology. Ultimately, this paved the way for treating maglignant plasma cell-induced disease and improving vaccine efficacy. While working at Immunitas, I had the opportunity to utilize cutting-edged methods in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data to explore innovative immunotherapeutic approaches for challenging cancer types. 

Last but not least, inspired by Steve Jobs' famous quote "Stay foolish, stay hungry", I am consistently motivated by my zeal for personal growth and professional development, and I eagerly tackle and embrace challenging tasks with enthusiasm and tenacity in pursuit of professional aspirations.
