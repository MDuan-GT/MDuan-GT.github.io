I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org) where I work in the [Regenerative Biology Group](https://morgridge.org/research/regenerative-biology/) and am co-advised by [Ron Stewart](https://morgridge.org/profile/ron-stewart/) and [Christina Kendziorski](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/). Prior to the Morgridge Institute, I received my bachelor's in computer science in 2013 from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu). I then went on to complete my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu), which I receieved in 2019 and was advised by [Colin Dewey](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/index.html). 

I work in the areas of computational biology and bioinformatics.  Specifically, I research new computational and statistical methods for mining large, heterogeneous biomedical datasets. My goal is to develop new models, databases, and tools that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these massive, public genomic datasets.  I use machine learning and statistical techniques extensively in my work.
