I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org) with a background in computer science. I work in the areas of computational biology and biomedical data science. More specifically, I research new computational and statistical methods for mining large, heterogeneous biomedical datasets. My goal is to develop new models, databases, and tools that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these massive, public genomic datasets. I use machine learning and statistical techniques extensively in my work.
