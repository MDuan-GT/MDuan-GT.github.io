I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Morgridge Institute for Research in Madison, Wisconsin.  I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in computer science and conduct research in the area of biomedical data science.  My research interests revolve around the development of novel statistical and computational methods for mining large, publicly available genomics databases.
