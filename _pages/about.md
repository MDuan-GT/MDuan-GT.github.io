I recently joined [Immunitas Therapeutics](https://www.immunitastx.com) as a Computational Biologist where I apply computational and statistical methods to single-cell RNA-seq data in order to discover new immunotherapies for challenging cancers. 

Before making the jump into industry, I received my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) in 2019 and then went on to complete a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org) in Madison, Wisconsin. In my academic life, I researched and developed new computational and statistical methods for mining large, heterogeneous biomedical datasets that would enable researchers to unleash the untapped knowledge contained within these massive, public genomic datasets in order to address outstanding questions in cell biology, human health, and disease.
