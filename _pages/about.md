I'm a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying computer science. My research area is in bioinformatics. Broadly, I am interested in the applications of algorithms and machine learning for extracting knowledge from large, publicly available repositories of biological data. More specifically, I am interested in methods for analyzing RNA-seq data ranging from upstream transcript quantification and metadata annotation to downstream development of predictive models.
