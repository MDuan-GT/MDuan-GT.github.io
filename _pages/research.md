## Leveraging heterogenous, public data and ontologies for classifying cell types in RNA-seq data

Gene expression-based classification of a biological sample’s cell type is an important step in many transcriptomic analyses, including that of annotating cell types in single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We explore the novel application of hierarchical classification algorithms that take into account the graph structure of the Cell Ontology to this task.

## Normalizing metadata for large, public genomics databases

The NCBI’s [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; 
however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the [poor structure](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201921) of the metadata associated with each sample. We developed the [MetaSRA](http://metasra.biostat.wisc.edu), a novel computational pipeline and associated database for standardizing the metadata associated with samples in the SRA by mapping each sample to biomedical [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).  See [my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVHMq9SdUtc) describing the MetaSRA from [ISMB 2018](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018).
