## MetaSRA: Normalized sample-specific metadata for the Sequence Read Archive

The NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; 
however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. We present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA human sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the 
metadata organization of the ENCODE project.

The MetaSRA is available at [metasra.biostat.wisc.edu](metasra.biostat.wisc.edu) via both a searchable web interface and bulk downloads. Software implementing our computational pipeline is available at [http://github.com/deweylab/metasra-pipeline](http://github.com/deweylab/metasra-pipeline).
