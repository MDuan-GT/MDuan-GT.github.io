Here are some quotes on a range of topics that inspire me:

"You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird… So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing — that’s what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something." **\~ Richard Feynman**

"A great idea…is like a phantom ocean beating upon the shores of human life in successive waves of specialization" **\~ Alfred North Whitehead**

"Sometimes it's difficult. You know, you always have this image of the perfect thing which you can never achieve, but which you never stop trying to achieve. I think at the core there’s this interior image you have that’s absolutely perfect. That's your signpost and your guide. You'll never get there, but without it you won't get anywhere." **\~ Cormac McCarthy**

"There is but one kind of unity possible in a world as diverse as ours. It is unity of method, rather than aim; the unity of disciplined experiment." **~ Walter Lippman**

"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." **\~ Antoine de Saint-Exupery**

"The places in-between places they are little countries themselves with their own holidays." **\~ Alberto Rios**

"Everything I’ve ever let go of has claw marks on it." **\~ David Foster Wallace**

"Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world." **\~ Bobby Kennedy**
