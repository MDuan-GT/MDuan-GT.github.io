I did not come into graduate school with a deep background in the mathematical topics used in computational biology. 
As I have been studying this material, I have found it helpful to create clean, organized notes in order to solidify 
my understanding. It occured to me that these notes may be useful to others, and so I will periodically post them here. 
These notes may contain minor mistakes or totally wrong information. Let me know if you find anything that can be improved.
